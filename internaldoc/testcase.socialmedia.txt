This script describes steps to test OU Blog standard tweet functionality.
It is intended to cover just the Tweet UI feature.

NOTE: In this test case, the word 'blog' always refers to the OU blog.

Some test steps in this script follow on from each other and aren't independent.
In these cases the prerequisite steps are listed.

Initial setup
=============

This test case requires:

- a text file 'post1.txt' for attachment-upload.
- a user with administration rights
- access to the personal blog.

The test server must have debugging set to DEVELOPER level and to display
errors; during all parts of the test script, there should be no debugging
warnings.

Note: With Javascript enabled a Twitter "Tweet" widget button will be provided,
without Javascript a "Tweet" link will be provided.
