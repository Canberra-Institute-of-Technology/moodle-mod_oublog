This script describes steps to test OU Blog standard functionality. It is intended to cover most of the UI and features.

NOTE: In this test case, the word 'blog' always refers to the OU blog.

Some test steps in this script follow on from each other and aren't independent. In these cases the prerequisite steps are listed.

warnings.
